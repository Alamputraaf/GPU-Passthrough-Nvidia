Previously, I had tried using the Single GPU-Passthorugh from Mutahar tutorial, but it always ended up kicking me into the SDDM login again and again. And ended up with Hybrid Graphics for now.

This Project thanks a lot to My Favorite Youtuber 'Mutahar' @Someordinarygamers and many more in documentation.
